# Welcome!
In this course we will learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language in a very casual setting. New concepts will only be introduced as needed and an effort will be made to only include relevant parts of the language's capabilities for the tasks at hand. In other words, we will progressively disclose information to prevent information overload. To reinforce the concepts, there will be exercises and breaks built into each notebook and a mini project at the end of each lesson.

## Interactive Notebooks
By far, the easiest and most casual way to get started would be to open each lesson as a Colab Notebook and experiment within a web browser. This offloads the work of setting up your development environment to a service so you can dive directly into learning about Python.
