    "- Prone to error\n",

    "We're able to break down, figure out, and explain complex tasks, but need plenty of time to do so and communicate our thoughts. Even then, we're bound to make mistakes and struggle to communicate our ideas at times. Humans also have limited cognitive resources and can only spend so much time on a task. We tend to struggle with complexity and need to figure out ways to handle it. \n",

    "Wouldn't it be great if we could combine the best of both worlds? Just imagine it... if we can be smart, fast, and accurate with a computer to solve complex problems...\n",
